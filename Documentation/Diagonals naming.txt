Diagonal naming convention in lilith:

ex. A1R

Diagonal starting on A file, beginning on rank 1, leaning to the right.

note diagonal according to lowest part on board.

diagonals are stored in uint_8 variables as follows:

L|FFF|XRRR
| |    | 
| |    rank
| File
Lean

The eighth bit denotes the diagonal's lean. 0 is right leaning, 1 left leaning.
Bits seven through five denote the diagonal's starting file.  
Bits three through one denote the diagonal's starting rank.
The fourth bit is unused as three bits is enough to note 8 different states.
