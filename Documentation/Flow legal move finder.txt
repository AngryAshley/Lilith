1. find all technically possible moves; + - X etc. (TRY ASM ALGORITHM!) 
1.5. place attack lines that intersect opponent's king in king attack register.
2. prune moves that are outside the board.
3. prune moves with special rules if they do not apply: en passant, castling.
4. prune moves that are blocked by a piece, add this piece in attacking register.
5. check for each piece except king if it is attacked and it's position is in the op. kings attack
   register. Prune if both are true. Skip if either register is empty.


//might implement:
  as step 4.5, repeat steps 1-4 for opponent to ensure attack history is set already. 
  This is unnecessary in a normal chess game, but some variations may allow this to be a 
  problem.
